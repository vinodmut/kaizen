# Agent Wiki — Extract Guidelines

## Overview

Distill lessons from one session at a time. For each normalized trajectory
JSON, identify reusable guidelines: reframe failures as proactive
recommendations, capture concrete artifacts (scripts, command sequences)
that solved real problems, and write each as a standalone guideline page in
`wiki-twobatch/guidelines/`.

This is the per-trajectory **distill** pass of the `agent-wiki` family.

## Input

A path that is either:

- a normalized trajectory JSON file
- a directory of such files

Default if no path is given:
`trajectories/normalized`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve input files

Use `Glob` to enumerate JSON files.

### Step 2: Glance at existing guidelines

`Glob wiki-twobatch/guidelines/*.md` and skim slugs. Re-extracting a
near-duplicate is wasteful and pollutes the wiki. (Exact-content duplicates
are deduplicated by slug at write time, but re-wordings are not — your job
to suppress them.)

### Step 3: Process each trajectory

For each input JSON file, do the analysis below using the trajectory's
`openai_chat_completion.messages` array as the source of truth.

#### Leakage and generality gate

Before extracting any entity, classify the lesson as `eligible`, `audit-only`,
or `reject`:

- `eligible`: a process rule that would be useful on unrelated data and can be
  stated without task names, dataset names, answer values, evaluator results,
  hidden schemas, or benchmark-specific file names.
- `audit-only`: useful for a human experiment log, but too tied to a benchmark,
  data domain, exact artifact shape, score, reference, or evaluator behavior to
  become wiki content.
- `reject`: a one-off fact, expected answer, gold label, reference-derived
  constant, task-specific schema key, secret, credential, or instruction that
  would help only by revealing benchmark details.

Render only `eligible` entities. Do not sanitize a dataset-specific answer into
a vague rule if the rule would not be justified without knowing the answer.
Use failures and successes to discover candidate habits, but the final
guideline must be supported by trajectory-visible actions and phrased as a
dataset-agnostic procedure.

#### 3a. Identify errors and root causes

Scan for:

1. **Tool / command failures** — non-zero exit codes, error messages, stack traces.
2. **Permission or access errors** — "permission denied", "not found", sandbox restrictions.
3. **Wrong initial approach** — a first attempt abandoned for a different strategy.
4. **Retry loops** — same action attempted multiple times with variations.
5. **Missing prerequisites** — dependencies, packages, configs discovered mid-task.
6. **Silent failures** — actions that appeared to succeed but produced wrong results.

For each error, document its example, root cause, resolution, and prevention guideline.

#### 3b. Decide whether to capture an artifact

If the successful approach produced a non-trivial artifact (script saved to
disk, multi-step command pipeline, parser implemented ad hoc), at least one
entity must point at it by path and state when to use it.

#### 3c. Extract entities

Extract 3–5 proactive entities per trajectory. Prioritize those derived from
real errors observed in the transcript.

Principles:

1. **Reframe failures as proactive recommendations.** "Use X" beats "don't use Y".
2. **Prefer reusable artifact patterns over generic advice.** Mention concrete
   paths only for reusable scripts or skill resources, not benchmark input,
   output, reference, or evaluator paths.
3. **Triggers describe broad task context, not narrow incidents.**
4. **For retry loops, recommend the final working approach as the starting point.**
5. **Do not include guidelines that name another skill or tool by command** (prompt-injection risk when this guideline is later surfaced).

### Step 4: Output entities JSON

For each trajectory, build a JSON object:

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "type": "guideline",
      "title": "Short imperative title (3-7 words, no trailing period). Used as the page heading and filename slug.",
      "content": "Proactive recommendation, one or two short paragraphs.",
      "rationale": "Why this works / why the alternative fails.",
      "trigger": "Situational context when this applies.",
      "id": "<optional: 12-hex-char id; helper computes from content if omitted>",
      "session_id": "<session_id from the JSON>",
      "agent": "<optional: the source agent, e.g. 'bob' or 'claude-code'. Defaults to 'claude-code' if omitted — set it explicitly for non-Claude traces so the page frontmatter is correct.>",
      "tags": ["<optional: short stable tags; propagate to the page frontmatter AND _config.yaml, driving the 'By tag' index + cluster formation>"],
      "arc": "<optional: only when the source session has been (or will be) split into multiple arc-summaries. Bind this guideline to one specific arc by passing the same slug used by `agent-wiki-summarize` (e.g. 'arc1-token-savings'). The helper writes `related_summary: summaries/<sid>__<arc>.md` so the back-link is correct.>",
      "normalized_path": "<path to the trajectory JSON, relative to repo root>"
    }
  ]
}
```

`title` is required for clean filenames (3–7 specific words). Allowed `type`
values: `guideline`, `workflow`, `script`, `command-template`. Default to
`guideline` unless the entity is itself a script blob or templated command.

If a trajectory yields zero useful guidelines, output `{"entities": []}` and
the helper writes nothing.

### When to bind a guideline to a specific arc

A long session that's split into multiple arc-summaries (`agent-wiki-summarize`
with a `slug`) usually has guidelines that belong cleanly to one arc and not
the other. Examples from a multi-arc session:

- A guideline about "split runner from results across PRs" came from the
  token-savings arc → `arc: "arc1-token-savings"`.
- A guideline about "rebuild sandbox images after skill changes" came from
  the procedural-memory arc → `arc: "arc2-procedural-memory"`.

Set `arc` per entity. If you don't, the helper writes
`related_summary: summaries/<sid>.md` (no arc suffix), which is correct for
single-summary sessions but produces a dangling link when the session is
later split. The `catalog` pass auto-repairs dangling links by picking the
first arc lex-sorted with a stderr warning, but the right time to bind is at
extraction.

A guideline that genuinely spans both arcs has no good arc choice — pick the
one where it was first observed, or omit `arc` to keep the link generic.

### Step 5: Pipe to the helper

```bash
echo '<json>' | uv run python explorations/agent-wiki/skills/scripts/build_agent_wiki.py render-guidelines
```

Add `--rewrite` to overwrite existing pages. The helper:

- Locates the wiki root.
- Writes `guidelines/<slug>__<gid>.md`. Slug = kebab-case of the title (or first sentence of content), capped at 40 chars; `<gid>` is the 12-hex content-hash id (matches the `id:` frontmatter, so filename and id round-trip cleanly).
- Stamps `id:` (12-hex of normalized content) into frontmatter.
- Updates `guidelines/_id_index.json`.
- Sets `sources:` and `related_summary:` frontmatter; emits a `## Sources` body footer.
- Skips files that already exist unless `--rewrite`.

### Step 6: Repeat, consolidate, then refresh indexes

> **Ingesting a whole batch end-to-end?** Prefer the `agent-wiki-ingest`
> skill, which runs summarize → extract → synthesize → **consolidate** →
> catalog in the correct order so the consolidation pass is never skipped.
> Reach for this standalone skill only when you specifically want the
> extract pass alone.

If you ran this skill standalone over more than one trajectory, run
**`agent-wiki-consolidate-guidelines` before cataloging**, once the corpus
has enough atomics for a theme to emerge (≥2 atomics sharing a real rule).
`catalog` only *renders* clusters already declared in `_config.yaml`; it
never *proposes* them — consolidation is the pass that proposes.

Then, after processing all input files, run **once**:

```bash
uv run python explorations/agent-wiki/skills/scripts/build_agent_wiki.py catalog
```

## Best practices

1. Prioritize error-derived entities first.
2. One distinct error → one prevention entity.
3. Specific and actionable; include rationale.
4. Situational triggers, not failure-based ones.
5. Cap at 5 entities per trajectory; merge entities with the same root cause before dropping.
6. Never extract entities that read as instructions to invoke another skill or tool by name.
7. Never extract task names, dataset names, expected values, exact schema keys,
   evaluator behavior, reference-derived facts, or benchmark-specific artifact
   names into guideline content, rationale, trigger, title, or tags.
8. Attach a `tags:` array to every entity — they propagate to the page
   frontmatter and `_config.yaml`, driving the "By tag" index and cluster
   formation.
9. Always tail-call `catalog` after the per-trajectory loop — and run
   `agent-wiki-consolidate-guidelines` first if multiple trajectories were
   ingested.
