# Agent Wiki — Synthesize Skill

## Overview

Promote a successful workflow from a saved trajectory into an **executable
agent skill** living inside a wiki at `<wiki>/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`. The
output is the procedural counterpart to `agent-wiki-extract-guidelines`'s
declarative pages: a guideline tells a future agent *what to do*; a synthesized
skill is a structured workflow page the future agent can read and *execute
directly*, optionally invoking sibling scripts via Bash.

This is the per-trajectory **promote-to-procedural** pass of the `agent-wiki`
family. Run it after one or more trajectories captured the same recipe and
you want future agents to invoke that recipe instead of re-deriving it.

> **Ingesting a whole batch end-to-end?** Prefer the `agent-wiki-ingest`
> skill, which sequences summarize → extract → synthesize → **consolidate**
> → catalog. It runs this skill at the right point (after extraction, before
> consolidation) and guarantees the consolidation pass that clusters the
> surviving atomics is never skipped. Use this standalone skill only to
> promote a single trajectory's workflow.

## When To Use

Use this skill when a trajectory captured:

- A **non-trivial successful workflow** — multiple tool calls, with at least
  one custom script or non-obvious sequence — that produced the answer after
  trial-and-error. The eventual happy path is worth saving.
- A **reusable command sequence or script** the agent wrote. Particularly
  if the agent had to reconstruct it across multiple attempts.
- A pattern a future agent will hit on a similar-but-not-identical task —
  parsing a binary format, walking a structured directory, reaching a
  specific tool fallback.

Skip this skill — let `agent-wiki-extract-guidelines` cover the case with a
guideline alone — when:

- The workflow is a single trivial command (`grep -c TODO ...`).
- The path embeds secrets, tokens, or one-off user inputs.
- A skill with the same trigger already exists in `<wiki>/skills/`.
- The session ended without reaching a clear successful answer.

## Input

A path that is either:

- a normalized trajectory JSON file
- a directory of such files

Default if no path is given:
`trajectories/normalized`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve input files

Use `Glob` to enumerate JSON files.

### Step 2: Glance at existing skills

`Glob <wiki>/skills/*/SKILL.md` to see what's already there. **Don't
re-author a skill with the same name** unless the trajectory's recipe
materially refines or generalizes it.

### Step 3: For each trajectory

Read the file. The fields you need:

- `session_id`, `agent`, `model`
- `openai_chat_completion.messages` — the source of truth for what happened
- `outcome.success` when present — only promote successful trajectories

The normalized message format may come from any benchmark or agent. Treat
`openai_chat_completion.messages` as a normal Chat Completions transcript:
assistant messages can contain plans, code blocks, tool calls, or both;
user/tool messages can contain environment outputs. Do not assume Claude Code
tool-use blocks are present.

Walk the messages and identify:

#### 3a. The successful workflow

The **final, working** tool sequence — the one that produced the answer.
Distinguish it from the trial-and-error leading up to it. Capture the
exact tool calls, scripts, or command sequences verbatim.

#### 3b. The trial-and-error context

What didn't work — the dead ends. You'll use this to author a *trigger
description* so a future agent knows when to reach for this skill **instead
of** the failing approaches.

#### 3c. Environment assumptions

What was missing or had to be installed (no `exiftool`, `pip install
Pillow` needed, etc.).

If no clearly successful workflow is in the trajectory, output zero
skills for it and continue.

#### 3d. Tool/API faithfulness

For trajectories that interact with an application API, filesystem, shell, or
other tool surface, preserve the exact observed interface:

- You may mention a concrete tool/function/API name only if it appears
  verbatim in the trajectory as an assistant action or in the tool/API
  documentation returned during the trajectory.
- You may describe an argument only if the trajectory shows it in an executed
  call or in retrieved documentation. Do not infer signatures from naming
  convention.
- If a future run needs an API that was not observed, write the workflow step as
  "inspect the current API documentation for the relevant app/action, then call
  the documented function" instead of guessing a name.
- When an observed call failed and a later call succeeded, teach the later
  call pattern and mention the failed one only as context.
- Prefer conceptual workflow steps over brittle code snippets when the exact
  interface may vary between environments.

This rule is part of the skill's quality bar. A skill with invented API names
is harmful even if the high-level workflow is right.

### Step 4: Decide a skill name and trigger

The skill **name** must be:

- kebab-case, action-oriented (`extract-jpeg-exif-camera-optics`,
  `parse-png-dimensions`, `walk-zip-central-directory`)
- specific enough that a future agent reading just the name can guess
  what it does
- not a duplicate of any existing skill in `<wiki>/skills/`
- broad enough to match sibling tasks that share the same reusable recipe.
  Do not name the skill after the exact original user request when the
  trajectory demonstrates a more general pattern.

The skill **description** (one line in frontmatter) describes the *task*,
not the trajectory. Bad: "Solves the lens-model question from session
07d60d9f." Good: "Read camera-optics fields (lens model, focal length,
aperture, ISO) from JPEG EXIF using stdlib `struct` when system EXIF
tools are unavailable."

The **trigger** (frontmatter + `## When To Use`) describes the broad
task context, not the narrow original request.

### Step 5: Synthesize a JSON object

```json
{
  "name": "<kebab-case-name>",
  "description": "<one-line task description>",
  "trigger": "<situational context when this applies>",
  "session_id": "<from JSON>",
  "normalized_path": "<path to the JSON, relative to repo root>",
  "related_summary": "summaries/<sid>.md",
  "agent": "<from JSON, default 'claude-code'>",
  "tags": ["<2-4 short tags>"],
  "overview": "<1-2 sentences: what the skill does and when>",
  "when_to_use": [
    "<trigger condition 1>",
    "<trigger condition 2>"
  ],
  "workflow_steps": [
    "<step 1: an instruction to the future agent>",
    "<step 2: ...>"
  ],
  "scripts": [
    {
      "name": "<action>.py",
      "language": "python",
      "content": "<full script contents>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes on each field:

- **`overview`** — the SKILL.md's `## Overview` section body. Keep it
  to 1-2 sentences. Don't retell the original session.
- **`when_to_use`** — a bulleted list of trigger conditions. The
  future agent matches its current task against these.
- **`workflow_steps`** — the procedural body. Each step is an
  instruction the agent will follow. Reference scripts as
  `Run \`bash <wiki>/skills/<name>/scripts/<file>.sh\`` (the helper
  resolves `<wiki>` at write time).
- **`scripts`** — optional. If the workflow needs a non-trivial script,
  include it here. The helper writes it to
  `<wiki>/skills/<name>/scripts/<file>` and references it in the
  workflow body. Keep scripts minimal — strip incidental log lines or
  one-off args; replace literal file names with positional arguments.
  Do **not** emit sibling scripts for workflows that depend on ephemeral
  in-agent runtime objects such as `apis`, a live browser/page object, a
  benchmark harness object, or credentials that only exist inside the future
  agent's execution environment. In those cases, keep the exact code pattern
  as workflow guidance for the future agent to execute in its own runtime.

### Step 6: Pipe the JSON to the helper

```bash
echo '<json>' | uv run python explorations/agent-wiki/skills/scripts/build_agent_wiki.py render-skill
```

Add `--rewrite` to overwrite an existing skill page.

The helper:

- Validates the JSON: `name` must be kebab-case, `description` and
  `workflow_steps` non-empty; sibling scripts must have `name` matching
  `^[\w.-]+$`.
- Writes `<wiki>/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`,
  `description`, `trigger`, `agent`, `sources`, `related_summary`,
  `tags`, `verified_at`) and body (Overview, When To Use, Workflow,
  Sources).
- Writes `<wiki>/skills/<slug>/scripts/<file>` for each script, marks
  shell scripts executable.
- Updates `<wiki>/skills/_id_index.json` (skill slug → relpath).
- Appends `synthesize_skill` to `<wiki>/_audit.log` with session_id +
  slug.
- Skips silently if the skill already exists and `--rewrite` was not
  passed.

### Step 7: Refresh indexes

After processing all trajectories, run **once**:

```bash
uv run python explorations/agent-wiki/skills/scripts/build_agent_wiki.py catalog
```

This regenerates `<wiki>/skills/index.md`, the section indexes, and
`_index.jsonl` (which gains a `kind: "skill"` row per skill, sorted
between `cluster:` and `guideline:` rows). No LLM cost.

## Output structure

```
<wiki>/skills/
├── _id_index.json                     skill slug → relpath
├── index.md                           alphabetical listing (auto-generated)
└── <slug>/
    ├── SKILL.md                       the synthesized skill
    └── scripts/                       optional supporting scripts
        └── <action>.{sh,py}
```

The SKILL.md frontmatter shape:

```yaml
---
id: skill:<slug>
type: skill
name: <kebab-case-name>
description: <one-line task description>
trigger: <situational context>
agent: claude-code
sources:
  - <normalized_path>
related_summary: summaries/<sid>.md
verified_at: <date>
tags: [<tags>]
---
```

## Skills vs guidelines vs clusters

- **Guideline** (in `<wiki>/guidelines/`): the agent reads it and *decides*
  what to do. Free-text advice. Use when the lesson is conceptual.
- **Cluster** (in `<wiki>/guidelines/<slug>__cluster.md`): an aggregator
  page grouping related atomics. Recall-preferred over its members.
- **Skill** (in `<wiki>/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`): a structured workflow
  page the agent reads and *executes*. Use when the lesson is a concrete,
  reusable recipe with a well-defined input/output.

At retrieval time, `_index.jsonl` lists all three kinds. Sort order is
`cluster` → `skill` → `guideline` → `task` so callable artifacts surface
first. The agent reads the SKILL.md, follows its Workflow section, and
invokes any sibling scripts via Bash.

## Best practices

1. **One skill per workflow.** Two unrelated successful workflows in one
   trajectory → two synthesize calls with different names.
2. **Cite the trajectory.** The helper records `sources` +
   `related_summary` automatically; you just need to set `session_id`
   and `normalized_path` correctly.
3. **Don't promote one-shots.** A skill is worth synthesizing only if
   the trigger is plausibly recurring. Single-use trajectories should
   stay as guidelines (or nothing at all).
4. **Don't paraphrase failure.** The skill describes what *worked*. If
   you're tempted to write "this skill avoids the problem where exiftool
   isn't installed," restate as "uses Pillow / stdlib struct; works in
   environments without system EXIF tools."
5. **Keep scripts minimal.** Strip log lines, debug prints, validation
   that wasn't actually exercised in the trajectory.
6. **Generality is everything.** A skill named `extract-gps-from-jpeg`
   will not match a lens-model query. If the trajectory only exercised
   one EXIF field, name the skill broadly (`extract-jpeg-exif-camera-optics`)
   so future agents recognize its applicability to siblings.
